🎟️ Online Ticket Booking Platform

(B12-A11_category-17)

📌 Project Overview

The Online Ticket Booking Platform is a full-stack MERN application that allows users to discover, book, and manage travel tickets such as Bus, Train, Launch, and Plane.
The platform supports three distinct roles — User, Vendor, and Admin — each with role-based dashboards and permissions.

This project was developed as part of a skill assessment assignment to demonstrate proficiency in full-stack development, authentication, authorization, payment integration, and production deployment.
